### Hey thanks for checking out our repository. Down below you will find a small tutorial on how to run our script!
______

1. First of all you to need clone this repository. ‚òùÔ∏è
2. After you have done this, either actviate the virtualenvironment in the keyword_paper_miner folder     like this:
    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
    or install all packages that are specified in the [requirements][req] file. <br> 
    A tutorial on how to use virtual environments can be found [here][venv].<br>
    When the virtual environment is active, you can simply run <br> 
    ```bash 
    pip install -r [path to requirements.txt]
    ```
    in order to run all needed packed in one go.
    >CAUTION: The requirement.txt file specifies versions of packages. These packages will be overwritten when being installed outside of the virtualenvironment!
    
3. Then you need to navigate with your terminal to *paper-miner/src/frontend* and run:
    ```bash
    export FLASK_APP=flask_file.py
    flask run
    ```
    You need this in order to tell FLASK which application you want to run.
4. After you have done this, somthing like this should appear:
    ```
    * Serving Flask app "flask_file.py"
    * Environment: production
     WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
     Use a production WSGI server instead.
    * Debug mode: off
     ```
5. Congratulations! üéâ <br>
Now the application should run on port 5000 on you localhost. Add one of the following URLs into your Browser!
    ```
    http://127.0.0.1:5000/
    or
    http://localhost:5000/
    ```
    From there on it should be self-explanatory. (Obvious hint: The Manual tab should be helpful üòâ)
6. If something is not working properly, please feel free to ask us! We will be happy to help you. üí°
